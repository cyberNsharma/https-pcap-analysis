# üîç HTTPS PCAP Analysis ‚Äî Wireshark Forensics Notes

This single-page note covers the complete HTTPS PCAP investigation questions (Q31‚ÄìQ36). It includes approach steps, Wireshark filters, and final answers ‚Äî all in one page for GitHub documentation or SOC/forensics learning.

### Q31 ‚Äî What has been added to web interaction with `web01.fruitinc.xyz`?
**Approach:**
1. Apply filters to capture packets related to `web01.fruitinc.xyz`.
2. Inspect GET or POST requests to identify new parameters or data values exchanged.
3. Use ‚ÄúFollow ‚Üí HTTP Stream‚Äù (if decrypted) to observe request body and data fields.
4. The newly added data will usually appear in POST payload or query string.
**Wireshark Filter Used:**  
`http.host == "web01.fruitinc.xyz" || tls.handshake.extensions_server_name == "web01.fruitinc.xyz"`  
**Answer:**  
`y2*Lg4cHe@Ps`

### Q32 ‚Äî What is the name of the photo that is viewed in Slack?
**Approach:**
1. Search HTTP/HTTPS requests for image file extensions like `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`.
2. Look inside URIs or ‚ÄúInfo‚Äù column to find any image access from Slack.
3. Use Follow ‚Üí HTTP Stream to confirm the filename requested.
4. The file viewed via Slack will be visible in the request URI.
**Wireshark Filter Used:**  
`http.request.uri contains ".jpg" || http.request.uri contains ".jpeg" || http.request.uri contains ".png"`  
**Answer:**  
`get_a_new_phone_today__720.jpg`

### Q33 ‚Äî What is the username and password to login to 192.168.2.1?
**Approach:**
1. Locate HTTP authentication traffic or POST login requests to the IP `192.168.2.1`.
2. Look for ‚ÄúAuthorization: Basic‚Äù header and decode Base64 string to find credentials.
3. Use ‚ÄúFollow ‚Üí HTTP Stream‚Äù to view cleartext authentication if visible.
4. If POST login, check form data in the HTTP request body.
**Wireshark Filter Used:**  
`ip.addr == 192.168.2.1 && (http.authbasic || http.request.method == "POST")`  
**Answer:**  
`admin:Ac5R4D9iyqD5bSh`

### Q34 ‚Äî What is the certStatus for the certificate with serial number `07752cebe5222fcf5c7d2038984c5198`?
**Approach:**
1. Filter packets for OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) responses.
2. Check response data containing the mentioned serial number.
3. Expand OCSP protocol details and locate the ‚ÄúcertStatus‚Äù field.
4. The status indicates if the certificate is valid, revoked, or unknown.
**Wireshark Filter Used:**  
`ocsp`  
**Answer:**  
`good`

### Q35 ‚Äî What is the email of someone who needs to change their password?
**Approach:**
1. Search for any HTTP packet containing the company email domain (`@fruitinc.xyz`).
2. Use the text search feature (Ctrl+F ‚Üí String ‚Üí Packet details) or filter below.
3. Identify the HTTP response mentioning a password reset or ‚Äúchange password‚Äù message.
4. Extract the email address from that payload.
**Wireshark Filter Used:**  
`http contains "@fruitinc.xyz"`  
**Answer:**  
`Jim.Tomato@fruitinc.xyz`

---

### Q36 ‚Äî A service is assigned to an interface. What is the interface, and what is the service?
**Approach:**
1. Search all frame contents for keywords like ‚Äúinterface‚Äù, ‚Äúservice‚Äù, or ‚Äúlan‚Äù.
2. Use text search or filter to locate configuration-related data.
3. The mapping (e.g., lan:ntp) will appear in plain text inside HTTP or JSON payload.
4. Confirm the relation of interface to service through packet info.
**Wireshark Filter Used:**  
`frame contains "interface" || frame contains "service"`  
**Answer:**  
`lan:ntp`
